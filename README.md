# Budget

This is a  Ruby on Rails capstone project from Microverse curriculum. It is about building a mobile web application where you can manage your budget: you have a list of transactions associated with a category, so that you can see how much money you spent and on what.

I created a Ruby on Rails application that allows the user to:
- register and log in, so that the data is private to them.
- introduce new transactions associated with a category.
- see the money spent on each category.

## Built With

- Ruby on Rails
- PostgreSQL as a databaase
- Rspec for testing
- bullet gem to prevent N+1 problems and eager loading
- cancancan gem for authorization rules
- Devise gem for authenticationb
